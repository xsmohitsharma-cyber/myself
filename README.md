### ⚡ About me  
I don’t believe tech should look cold. I make infra breathe, clouds obey, and teams move like one mind.  
Work is logic. Coaching is emotion. Astrology is intuition.  
Put all three together — you get clarity plus execution.

### 📚 Author • The Writer Side of Me

Words are my second language.  
Technology builds systems; writing builds people.

My books explore growth, clarity, and the inner architecture of life.  
Not theory for reading — thought weapons for *living*.

Tech + Astrology.  
Left brain + Right brain.
